**BACKGROUND**

A bike sharing program called Citi Bike has been running a successful business in New York City. The biking data is available online and has useful information such as biking duration, gender, age, rout, etc. The idea for this analysis is to figure out  how the Citi Bike data for New York City applies to Des Moines. 

**OBJECTIVE**

The objective of this analysis is to determine if the New York City Citi Bike data can be used to assure investor the same program can be applied in Des Moines. To do so, the following research questions has been developed: 

- What is the gender diversity of Des Moines and how does it compare to the gender diversity of New York City? What effect does it have on possible business in Des Moines? 
-  What is the population of Des Moines? How does its population compare to the population of New York City? Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program? 

**ANALYSIS**

In order to answer the research questions, the following table was developed according to Census Bureau online data. 

| TABLE 1                                           | New York City | Des Moines |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| Female %                                          | 52.30%        | 50.80%     |
| Population                                        | 8,175,133     | 203,433    |
| Population Age  < 18 years                        | 20.90%        | 24.50%     |
| Persons without health insurance, <65  years old  | 9.60%         | 8.20%      |
| Mean travel  time to work (minute), >16 years old | 41.2          | 19         |
